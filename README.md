# Schedulability Analysis and Performance Optimization of Dynamic AVR Task Model #

The file "EngineOptimization.pdf" provides the technical details for two optimization procedures "dAVR-exact" and "dAVR2sAVR-exact".

The source code evaluates:
- the engine control performance of the optimization procedures using static and dynamic AVR task model
- the accuracy of the schedulability analysis techniques for the dynamic AVR task model

And the code has been tested to work well in Visual Studio 2012 with Microsoft Windows 7, and Unix-like systems (e.g., Ubuntu and Raspberry Pi Desktop).
